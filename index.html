    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      A London-based selector and producer, Will is making rapid strides in the electronic music scene. Recognised at just 18 by BBC Radio 1Xtra, he has since captivated audiences with his hypnotic, immersive grooves, crafting a sound that truly stands out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willâ€™s sets draw from his extensive and meticulously curated record collection, a testament to his deep reverence for the rich history of underground club culture that has shaped the UK scene over decades of community-driven sound. Drawing in hidden corners of techno and house, he brings a raw, authentic energy to his sets, built with cohesion and meaningful progression. Being a DJ since his early youth, Will's passion for selection is unmistakable and refined, yet his mixing style remains playful and precise, making each set feel fresh and unpredictable.
